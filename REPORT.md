# Lab 2 Web Server -- Project Report

## Description of Changes
### Controllers and Services 
- A new /time endpoint which give us the current time in JSON was added with TimeController.
- The default Spring Boot error page was customized by creating an error.html
### SSL and HTTP/2
- Turned on HTTPS on port 8443 using a self-signed PKCS12 keystore (localhost.p12) I generated with OpenSSL.
- Configured Spring Boot to support HTTP/2 over SSL in application.yml.
- Tested everything using curl --http2 -k to make sure HTTPS and HTTP/2 were working.
### Tests
- Wrote integration tests for the /time endpoint and the custom error page using TestRestTemplate
- Added unit tests for TimeController using mocks (TimeProvider) to test the controller logic in isolation.
- Created MVC tests using MockMvc (like TimeControllerMVCTest) to verify HTTP responses, JSON serialization, and status codes for the controller.
## Technical Decisions
- TimeProvider + Dependency Injection: Made the controller easier to test and more flexible.
- DTO + Extension Function: Clean way to convert LocalDateTime into JSON.
- HTTPS + HTTP/2: Security + better performance.
- Custom Error Page: Better user experience.
- Integration Tests: Make sure everything works in a real HTTP scenario.
## Learning Outcomes
- How to configure SSL and HTTP/2 in Spring Boot.
- Working with REST endpoints, DTOs, and Kotlin extension functions.
- Why dependency injection and interfaces are useful.
- Writing integration tests for HTML and JSON responses.
- Debugging SSL keystore issues and using OpenSSL in WSL/Windows.

## AI Disclosure
### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT
### AI-Assisted Work
- error.html generated with ChatGpt
- The first version of the tests was generated by Ai(unit and integration tests).
- About 50% of the work was AI-assisted, mostly the initial versions of tests and base code; the rest was adaptation, correction, and adjustments for my project.
### Original Work
- I modified and adapted all AI-generated tests so they worked correctly with my project.
- Configured the server and tested the endpoints until everything worked correctly.
- Implemented the SSL/HTTP2 configuration manually.
